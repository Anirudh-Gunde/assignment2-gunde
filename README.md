Assignment 2

# Anirudh Gunde
###### Indian Cricket Team

I like this sport because of my dad. He is fond of this game,he will comment on every match we watch. As I got my interest build on this sport I used to have my hand wherever I got chance to. It helped me in re-energyzing myself. My favourite cricketers are **MS Dhoni** and **Virat Kholi** as they inspired me by their attitude and conviction towards what they are doing in the game.
